My name is Hasan Kataya. Iâ€™m a 20 year old web developer/designer based in Beirut, Lebanon. I am fast paced and a quick learner with a huge passion for software web development, both on the front end as well as the server side.


 Quality is the main principle of my work. I always strive to build software that is elegant, functional, and performant. I aim to leverage my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js among other web technologies to provide the best value to meet your needs.
